This mutation deletes exon 2 and 117 bp of flanking intronic sequence including the splice acceptor and donor. In addition there are 2 small insertions of 14 and 7 bp in the intron sequence, which will not affect the exon deletion.  This mutation is predicted to cause an amino acid sequence change after residue 139 and early truncation 139 amino acids later.

This allele from project Iqca-7545J-F2516 was generated at The Jackson Laboratory by injecting Cas9 RNA and 4 guide sequences ACTCAAACCCCACCACCATG, CGAAGAAGTCTGCAGACAAT, GCACCTTTAACAGAACCCAC and GTGGATAGCATTCATCCATG, which resulted in a 524 bp deletion spanning exon 2 beginning at Chromosome 1 negative strand position 90,145,184 bp, TCATCCATGAGGTTGTCTAA and ending after ACTCAAACCCCACCACCAT at 90,144,661 bp (GRCm38/mm10) with a single base pair insertion, A, in place of this deletion. This mutation deletes exon 2 and 199 bp of flanking intronic sequence including the splice acceptor and donor, and is predicted to result in a change in amino acid sequence after residue 4 and early truncation 11 amino acids later. In addition, there is a 4 bp (gtgg) deletion 39 bp before the 524 bp deletion that is not predicted to impact the outcome of this mutation.

This allele from project Mcmbp2-7557J-M9618 was generated at The Jackson Laboratory by injecting Cas9 RNA and 4 guide sequences CTGCGCTACTTCTAGTCACG, TTCTGTGTTGTGCCTCTAGA, GGACACTCACAGGTATTCAA and TCACCAGGCACCGCAAACCC, which resulted in a 361 bp deletion spanning exon 2 beginning at Chromosome 7 negative strand position 128,725,395 bp, AGGGAGCTAAGGGCAAGCAG and ending after CCGCCCCACCAGCCACGTGAC at 128,725,035 bp (GRCm38/mm10). This mutation deletes exon 2 and 275 bp of flanking intronic sequence including the splice acceptor and donor. There is also a small 10bp deletion (gcctctagat) 82 bp after the 361bp deletion that will not affect the results of the mutation.  This mutation is predicted to result in a change in amino acid sequence after residue 19 and a early truncation after an additional 28 amino acids.

Molecular Description 

This allele from project PigC- 6237J (line 103 M(R)) was generated at The Jackson Laboratory by injecting Cas9 RNA and guide sequences TGTAGTGATCTGGTGGTACA and CCCCAGTGGCTTTTTGGGAC which resulted in a 1 bp deletion T in exon1 beginning at chromosome 1 + strand position 161970654 bp (GRCm38/mm10).  This mutation is predicted to cause amino acid sequence changes after residue 67 and early truncation 1 amino acid later. There is a second mutation in this allele (34 bp after the 1 bp deletion), an 11 bp del tggctccccag in exon 1 beginning at chromosome 1 + strand position 161970689, which does not change the frameshift and early truncation of Pigc described above.

TAGCCAGTCCGCCTAAAAGT, AGTAGGTGCTAGGAATTCCA, GTCATTCTCAGGAGACTGCA, GCTGTTGCAACAGGGATGGC, which resulted in a 301 bp deletion beginning in intron 3 at Chromosome 17 positive strand position 43,594,225(CTACTTTTAGGCGGACTGGCTA) and ending after (CTAACCGGCCATCCCTGTTG) at 43,594,525 bp (GRCm38/mm10) in intron 4.  This mutation deletes exon3 and is predicted to cause amino acid sequence changes after residue 35 and early truncation 30 amino acids later. 

In addition there is a small 16bp deletion 12 bases before the beginning of the 301bp deletion. This additional deletion is in intron 3 and is not expected to affect the exon deletion results.

This mutation deletes exon 2 and 203 bp of flanking intronic sequence including the splice acceptor and donor. In addition there is a single bp insertion (A) at the site of the deletion and another insertion (T) 37 bp before the 333 bp deletion that will not alter the result of the mutation.

This allele from project Slc44a2-7954J-F6530 was generated at The Jackson Laboratory by injecting Cas9 RNA and 4 guide sequences CAGAAGAAGCTGGAGAGCCG, TGTGTCTGCATGCTACCAAC, TTTGCCGGAGAACACACACT and CACATCCCTCGTGGGGAAGA, which resulted in a 231 bp deletion beginning at Chromosome 9 positive strand position 21,338,315 bp TGTAGTCCCCTGTTGGTAGC, and ending after TGGGGAGATGTGTCCCAGTG at 21,338,545 bp (GRCm38/mm10). This mutation deletes exon 2 and 182 bp of flanking intronic sequence including the splice acceptor and donor. There is a single bp insertion (A) at the site of the deletion that will not alter the results of the mutation. This exon deletion is predicted to cause a change of amino acid sequence after residue 13 and early truncation 15 amino acids later.

This allele from project Telo2-7804J-9704M was generated at The Jackson Laboratory by injecting Cas9 RNA and 4 guide sequences CTCTTCTCAGAAATGTGGCG, CCATGAGAGATGTCGAGGCA, AAGGCAACACTAGGCAGAGG and CAACACTAGGCAGAGGGGGG, which resulted in a 465 bp deletion around exon 3 beginning at Chromosome 17 negative strand position 25,113,380 bp, GGCTTATTTTACCACTGAGC, and ending after CTTCTCTTCTCAGAAATGTG at 25,112,916 bp (GRCm38/mm10). This mutation deletes exon 3 and 187 bp of flanking intronic sequence including the splice acceptor and donor. In addition there is an insertion of two bp (AA) at the site of the mutation that will not effect the result of the deletion. This mutation is predicted to cause a change of amino acid sequence after residue 112 and early truncation 55 amino acids later.

CCTTGAGAAAAGCAGCAGCCTA at position 39,046,725 bp in intron 3 (GRCm38). This mutation deletes 64 bp in exon 2 and 42 bp into intron 3 removing the splice donor site.  This mutation is predicted to cause an amino acid change after residue 81 and early truncation after amino acid residue 83. In addition there is a 23 bp deletion in intron 2 (AAGGGAGGAACACCCTGTAACTT) Chromosome 8 positive strand position 39046469 - 39046492bp, which is not predicted to affect the amino acid sequence.
